# Banking Transaction Insights.
The Banking Transaction Insights Dashboard is an interactive data analytics project designed to provide actionable insights into customer transactions for the banking sector. This dashboard highlights transaction trends, customer demographics, and transaction types, enabling better decision-making and strategy development for stakeholders.
## Technologies Used
- **Microsoft Excel**: Utilized for data cleaning, handling missing values, and initial preparation of raw data.  
- **SQL**: Employed for running queries to extract, manipulate, and analyze transaction data for insights.  
- **Power BI**: Used to build interactive and visually compelling dashboards for presenting insights.

## Project Objectives
- Analyze customer transaction patterns to identify key trends and anomalies.
- Provide insights into customer behavior based on demographic attributes like age and occupation.
- Evaluate transaction channels (online, offline) and device usage to improve banking services.
- Highlight potential fraud indicators using suspicious patterns in transaction data.
 
## Key Features
1.   Transaction Trends
   - Analyze transaction volumes and amounts over time to identify peak and low activity periods.  
   - Provide actionable insights into seasonal trends and customer behavior changes.  

2. Customer Demographics  
   - Segment customer behavior by age groups and occupations.  
   - Uncover key customer segments driving high transaction activity.  

3. Channel Performance  
   - Compare transaction volumes across online and offline channels.  
   - Identify the most and least used transaction channels for targeted improvements.  

4. Device Analysis
   - Monitor transaction patterns across devices (e.g., mobile, desktop).  
   - Determine the preferred platforms for banking services.  

5.  Fraud Indicators 
   - Highlight anomalies like high login attempts, unusual transaction durations, or suspicious patterns.  
 
##  Dashboard Highlights 
-  KPIs:  
  - Total transaction amounts.  
  - Average transaction value.  
  - Number of transactions by channel and device.  

- **Visualizations**:  
  - Bar charts to show transaction trends by channel, device, and time.  
  - Pie charts and donut charts to represent customer segmentation and channel performance.  
  - Line charts for analyzing transaction trends over time.  

  - Fraud Metrics:  
  - Indicators such as high login attempts and unusually long transaction durations are highlighted.
 
##  How It Was Built 
1.  Data Cleaning:  
   - Data was imported into Microsoft Excel for cleaning and preprocessing.  
   - Handled missing values and removed duplicates to ensure data accuracy.  

2.  SQL Queries:  
   - Ran SQL queries to extract and transform data for in-depth analysis.  
   - Focused on analyzing transaction patterns, customer behavior, and channel performance.  

3.  Power BI Dashboards :  
   - Designed visually appealing dashboards to display insights clearly and interactively.  
   - Created calculated measures and fields to enhance visualization accuracy and interactivity.  
 
## Why This Project Stands Out 
This project showcases a complete data analytics workflow, from raw data to actionable insights, demonstrating expertise in:  
- Data cleaning and preparation (Excel).  
- Query-based data analysis (SQL).  
- Interactive dashboard creation (Power BI).  
The Banking Transaction Insights Dashboard** is an excellent example of how data analysis can address real-world challenges in the banking sector and empower stakeholders to make informed decisions.
## Conclusion
This project reflects my ability to manage the end-to-end data analytics process, providing clarity, precision, and actionable outcomes. It highlights my technical proficiency and my focus on delivering insights that matter to non-technical stakeholders.
